                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    <br><br>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
                    control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; 
                    for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, 
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, 
                        and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                         extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the 
                         application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does
                    not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                <header><b>Hello world</b></header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

            <section class="main-section"id="variables">
                <header><b>Variables</b></header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    <br><br>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). 
                    Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                    <br><br>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in 
                    identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
